# Cline Rules for Octopus Repository

## Code Modification Best Practices

### Import Management
- **Always change code first, then add imports** to avoid formatting conflicts
- When adding new functionality that requires imports, follow this order:
  1. Make the code changes first
  2. Add the necessary imports after the code is working
  3. This prevents auto-formatter conflicts between code and import changes

### Environment Management
- **Always activate the octo conda environment** when running Python tools or commands
- If any command fails due to missing dependencies or environment issues, prefix with `conda activate octo &&`
- Default command pattern: `conda activate octo && [your command]`

### File Editing Strategy
- Use `replace_in_file` for targeted changes to existing files
- Use `write_to_file` only for new files or complete rewrites
- When making multiple changes to the same file, use a single `replace_in_file` call with multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks

### Testing and Validation
- Always run tests after making changes to verify functionality
- Run `ruff check .` to ensure code quality standards are maintained
- **Regularly run `pre-commit run --all-files`** to ensure all formatting and linting standards are met
- If pre-commit shows errors, run it **3 times** as pre-commit applies formatting incrementally
- For Python changes, activate the octo environment before running tests

### Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 standards for Python code
- Ensure proper docstring formatting (Google style)
- Add type hints where required by the project configuration
- Keep imports organized at the top-level of files

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Octopus Framework
- This is a machine learning framework with specific dependencies
- Always use the `octo` conda environment for Python operations
- Pay attention to sklearn compatibility requirements
- Feature importance methods require proper configuration (e.g., positive_class for classification)

### Common Commands
```bash
# Activate environment and run tests
conda activate octo && python -m pytest [test_file] -v

# Activate environment and check code quality
conda activate octo && ruff check .

# Run pre-commit checks (run 3 times if errors occur)
conda activate octo && pre-commit run --all-files

# Activate environment and run Python scripts
conda activate octo && python [script_name].py
```

## Error Prevention
- Before running any Python command, check if octo environment is needed
- When encountering import errors or missing modules, activate octo environment
- When making code changes that affect imports, change code first, then imports
- Always wait for tool completion before proceeding to next step
