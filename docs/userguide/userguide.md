```{admonition} Backwards Compatibility and Deprecations
:class: info
Octopus is in a constant state of development. As part of this, interfaces and objects
might change in ways breaking existing code. We aspire to provide backwards **support
for deprecated code of the last three minor versions**. After this time, old code will
generally be removed. Both the moment of deprecation and full removal (deprecation
expiration) will be noted in the [changelog](/misc/changelog_link).
```

The most commonly used interface BayBE provides is the central
[`Campaign`](baybe.campaign.Campaign) object,
which suggests new measurements and administers the current state of
your experimental operation. The diagram below explains how the
[`Campaign`](baybe.campaign.Campaign) can be used to perform
the bayesian optimization loop, how it can be configured and
how the results can be post-analysed.
