# User Guide

Octopus is in a constant state of development. As part of this, interfaces and objects
might change in ways breaking existing code. We aspire to provide backwards **support
for deprecated code of the last three minor versions**. After this time, old code will
generally be removed. Both the moment of deprecation and full removal (deprecation
expiration) will be noted in the [changelog](/changelog).

The most commonly used interface Octopus provides is the central
[`OctoStudy`](/reference/study) object.
